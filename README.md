# DiscordChatGraph
To talk to my friends I primarily use the app Discord, and with it comes a handy feature to find certain messages with a simple ctrl-f. I really liked being able to look up little statistics like how many times I’ve said a word since starting to use discord, and so about a year ago I made a quick little program in python processing that would sort of graph out words that you said from that. Earlier this winter break though, after another semester of C++ classes, I decided to try rewriting it in C++ and cleaned up the whole process:

Above’s a graph generated by it between me (sqwigly) and my friend (mitty) for the uses of the word “game” between 2018 and now. My favorite part of the program is how nearly everything in the program is written to handle nearly every situation— massive amounts of data, very small amounts, different screen sizes, different spaces between years— heres an example of a different, much smaller set between me and a different friend:
